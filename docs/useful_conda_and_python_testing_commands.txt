Remind me how to run the tests at the command line again?

To run the tests from the command line, you can use Python's built-in unittest framework. 
From the root directory of your project, run:
    python -m unittest discover tests
    
    # Using unittest (built-in)
    python -m unittest discover tests

    # Using pytest (needs to be installed)
    pytest
    
    # or for more verbose output
    pytest -v
    
    
Or if you want to run a specific test file:
    python -m unittest tests/test_plot_manager.py
    
For more verbose output, add the -v flag:
    python -m unittest discover tests -v


This will show you each individual test that passes or fails, rather than just a summary.
